message[1] = initial viewport width (in columns)
message[2] = initial viewport height (in rows)

Host bound 0x01 On viewport resize
message[1] = new viewport width (in columns)
message[2] = new viewport height (in rows)

Host bound 0x02 On input char
message[1] = utf-16 character
message[2] = modifier flags
  from lsb to msb
